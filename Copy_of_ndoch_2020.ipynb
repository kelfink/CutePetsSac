        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "This project focuses on the asset map item for the Code for America (CFA) National Day of Civic Hacking (NDocH) [event][02.01]; it consists of this notebook to visualize various assets within the Sacramento area. The data is sourced from various open data portals and provides the deliverables listed below.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Deliverables*\n",
        "1. Asset Maps: Shared as HTML files in maps folder and within notebook\n",
        "2. Notebook: Contains all code and documentation needed for visualization\n",
        "3. Documentation: Notebook and README contains full write-up and results\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note: Data processing and maps are created using Jupyter Notebook due to its ability to visualize results effectively and efficiently. Listed below are installation instructions and more about Jupyter and Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "### CFA NDoCH\n",
        "The event NDoCH instructions are shown below and specify that open data sources should be used to visualize resources available to the Sacramento community. This notebook is intended as starting point to visualize such data for further development.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Asset mapping is an integral part of empowered community building that is based on understanding the strengths and needs of diverse communities. First, use publicly available information about your locale to give a sense of the landscape and demographics. Next, research the location and availability of government programs (e.g. county health and human services offices), community based organizations (like resource centers, food banks, and legal aid clinics) or other resources that are vital to your community. Visually documenting the landscape can help identify what might make your community more equitable and accessible to all who live there.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Methodology\n",
        "This notebook starts with a tutorial using Python mapping tools as a prototype, then develops asset maps for the Sacramento area. Open data sources are listed below and will be added to with additional development.\n",
        "\n",
        "> One desired outcome for this project is to develop a better understanding of publicly available data, appropriate tools and spatial analysis technique in develop the asset maps. As a result, project methodology, assumptions and results are documented in this readme.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key project assumptions are listed below and validated through analysis and visualization of publicly available datasets. They serve as an outline for guide development of the notebook, analysis and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Assumptions*\n",
        "1. Publicly available data via open data portals are typically good quality and therefore suitable for use in generating equity/asset maps\n",
        "2. Data science tools such as Jupyter, Python and the Folium plotting package are appropriate tools to analyze, communicate and share results\n",
        "3. All selected tools are open-source software, and all analysis is repeatable, documented and reproducible to improve accessibility  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Results\n",
        "Asset maps are summarized below and organized into separate modules within the notebook. Each map is available as a separate HTML file in the maps folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Data Processing Steps*\n",
        "1. Import raw data, then process it with helper functions as needed\n",
        "2. Lat/long coordinate CSV and GeoJSON formats used for analysis\n",
        "3. GeoJSON data was converted to JSON for plotting within Folium\n",
        "4. Geospatial data was plotted with helper functions\n",
        "5. Complete map is output within notebook and as separate file\n",
